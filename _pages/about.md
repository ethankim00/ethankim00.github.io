After growing up in Boston, I moved across the river to join the Harvard College Class of 2021. I completed my Bachelor's in Statistics with a Secondary in Computer Science. On campus, I directed consulting operations for the [Harvard College Data Analytics Group](https://www.harvardanalytics.org/). where I sourced clients and helped the club grow to 100+ members. Previously, I let a team of six on a consulting project for a sports analytics company. Before getting into Data Science, I was heavily involved in Biology and Microfluidics research. 

My current research interests are in Natural Language Processing, specifically parameter efficient few shot learning and interpretability. 

After college I joined Cyndx in NYC as a Data Scientist. 

Outside of work I enjoy reading science fiction, volunteering, lifting and playing soccer.
