After growing up in Boston, I moved across the river to join the Harvard College Class of 2021, I am a passionate student studying Statistics with a focus on Data Science with a Secondary in Computer Science. On campus I am a case team leader and founding member of the Harvard College Data Analytics Group where I lead teams on Data Science consulting projects. Previously, I was heavily involved in Biology and Microfluidics research. 

Outside of class I enjoy reading science fiction, volunteering at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and playing soccer.
