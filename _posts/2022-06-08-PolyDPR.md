## Introduction

- What is the name of the poly-DPR paper?
    
    > Improving Biomedical Information Retrieval with Neural Retrievers
    > 
    
- What are the main contributions of the poly -DPR paper?
    - each context is represented by k vectors
        - still employ MIPS
    - TempQG: template based question generation method
        - can generate a large number of in domain questions
    - 2 pretraining tasks: ETM and RSM
    

## Method

- Poly DPR uses `colBERT style` maxsim
    
    
- TempQG uses a seq2seq model with a `passage and template` as input

- TempQG templates are generated by `masking low frequency tagged biological entities`
    - also do DPR with text input to select

- PolyDPR pretraining task: Extended Title Mapping retreives an abstract based on `title + concatenated top tfidf words`

## Results

- Poly-DPR results: best performance with most `granular sub document representations`
    - obvious tradeoff with time

## Conclusions

- good experimental evidence about using subdocument representations vs encoding entire document
- Compare against T5query uses in GPL
