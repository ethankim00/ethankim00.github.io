- What is the name of the SpanBERT paper?
    
    > SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing
    and Predicting Spans

- How does SpanBERT modify BERT?
    - mask contiguous spans rather than random tokens
    - training span boundary representation to predict the entire content of the masked span
    - remove NSP
    - slight improvement on some tasks

- SpanBERT combines normal MLM loss and `span boundary prediction` loss
    - encourage boundary tokens to encode span information

- SpanBERT compares different span sampling schemes like geometric, noun phrases,  named entities and `whole words`
