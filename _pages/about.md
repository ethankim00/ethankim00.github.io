After growing up in Boston, I moved across the river to join the Harvard College Class of 2021. Currently I am taking a leave of absence working at an aviation company for the fall 2020. I am a passionate student studying Statistics with a focus on Data Science along with Secondary in Computer Science. On campus the Director of Consulting for the [Harvard College Data Analytics Group](https://www.harvardanalytics.org/). Previously, I was a Case Team Leader and led a team of six on a Data Science Consulting Project. Before getting into Data Science, I was heavily involved in Biology and Microfluidics research. 

Outside of class I enjoy reading science fiction, volunteering at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and playing soccer.
