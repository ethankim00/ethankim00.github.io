## Introduction

- What is the name of the PALM paper?
    
    > PaLM: Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways
    > 

## Method

- PALM was trained on `780 billion tokens of high-quality text`
    
    
- Pathways is google’s `scaling infrastructure for TPUs`
    - train PALM on 6144 TPU v4 chips
- PALM scaling laws show `lack of approaching saturation point`
    
    
- PALM breakthrough capabilities:  better results on `reasoning tasks`
    - combine with chain of thought prompting
- PALM exhibits discontinuous improvements on `25% of big bench tasks`
    - large jumps in performance from 62B to 540 B parameters
    
- PALM has strong multilingual performance with `22% non english training data`
    
    
- Main PALM architectural advancements:
    - SwiGLU activation
        - outperform ReLU in compute equivalent experiments
    - Parallel layers
        - run attention and MLP computation in parallel
    - Multiquery attention
        - share key and value projections for each head
- PALM multiquery attention leads to `cost savings during autoregressive decoding`
    
    
- PALM uses Shared `Input-Output Embeddings`
    - used in some transformer architectures
- Plurality of PALM training data comes from `social media conversations`

- Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (Smith et al.,
2022) was trained on `2240 A100 GPUs`
- PALM sequence length is `2048`
    
    
- PaLM is finetunedwith 5 × 10−5
learning rate using the Adafactor optimizer, with a batch size of 32. PaLM converges typically
in less than `15K steps of finetuning`
    
    
- PALM bigbench results: SOTA on `most tasks`

- Multistep reasoning categories include `arithmetic and commonsense reasoning`
    
    
- Chain of thought prompting adds `step by step examples to in context prompts`
    - model will generates its reasoning before generating the final answer

## Results

- PALM evaluates language model memorization by `prompting with 50/100 tokens of training text and greedy decoding`
    
    
- PALM memorization results: large model `memorizes more`

- PALM explanation experiments use `two shot exemplars`
    - followed by greedy decoding
    - example: joke explanation
