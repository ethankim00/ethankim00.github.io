In 2021 I contributed to the Big-Bench suite of NLP tasks, aiming to probe the abilities of large language models. Inspired by sports, I developed a task aiming to test the world knowledge and reasoning ability of large language models. Given that a little over a year later, the task has essentially been solved I decided to summarize the progress and interesting developments for this specific task. 

The task itself asks participants to determine if a sentence about sports is plausible or implausible: For example, given the sentence:

> Tom Brady made a layup in the NBA Final
> 

The answer is “implausible” because Tom Brady is a football player and would not be making a basketball play in a basketball game. 

The human performance on the task is primarily driven by accumulated world knowledge about sports. Human participants had zero difficulties grasping the aim of the task and the need to match players to their respective sports. However given the breadth of examples, most participants were not familiar with every athlete and sport presented. Therefore the fact that large language models can outperform human benchmarks is not as interesting as the way in which these behaviors emerge 

It took just over a year for me to consider the task solved by large language models with the SOTA performance at 98% (Sugzun 2022).  Initially smaller LMs performed no better than random in both the few shot and zero-shot regimes. However, we can track the ultimate cracking of the task through model scale and prompting techniques.

This plot from Wei et al shows the error rate on the task as a function of model compute in FLOPs for google’s Lambda model. We can see a definite inflection point in terms of emergent behavior

It appears that solving the task is an emergent ability of large language models. The paper classifies sports understanding as emergent for GPT-3 and Lambda meaning that performance on this task appears to be suddenly emergent at this regime of model size. I believe that this is somewhat surprising given that the task is not particularly complicated and should be solvable few shot by smaller models. However, we will see that a combination of model scale and better prompting techniques are essential to solve the task. 

The task is explicitly designed to test a two-step logical reasoning process: From the above example the language model should be able to reason from the implications Tom Brady plays football and basketball players make layups → Tom Brady making a layup is less plausible. The development of Chain of Thought prompting gives language models this exact ability.  We can construct the modified COT prompts very easily:

Which immediately results in a dramatic performance gain:

Interestingly, with Chain of Thought prompting, even smaller models (8B) parameters are able to reach human-level performance.  In addition, we see the emergence of behavior at smaller model scales (OpenAi -curie vs davinci). 

It’s an interesting question as to whether performance at scale is driven by more world knowledge memorization capabilities vs reasoning capabilities. Given that we know that all PALM variants were trained on the same data we can speculate about the relative contributions. At 8Billion parameters, PALM does little better than random however with Chain of Thought prompting performance improves dramatically.  This illustrates how Chain of Thought prompting elucidates latent world knowledge already present in the 8Billion parameter model.  However it’s possible that the smaller-scale PALM model did not have the capacity to pick up on all of the world knowledge needed to solve the task in the single epoch training. Assuming a lot of sports understanding relevant data comes from New articles, we can see that two larger PALM variants memorize training the training data to approximately the same degree.

Given this fact we can theorize that the gains from 62B to 540B parameters are driven mostly by improved reasoning ability while gains from 8B to 62B may also be a factor of world knowledge. I believe this hypothesis could be rigorously evaluated by thoroughly probing the models for the necessary factual knowledge for each task. Then we can correlate the degree of task-relevant world knowledge with task performance. Such experiments could explain why some other tasks requiring world knowledge failed to demonstrate improvement with COT prompting.

	abstract = {Language models demonstrate both quantitative improvement and new qualitative capabilities with increasing scale. Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 442 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit "breakthrough" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.},

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261},
	abstract = {BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) is a diverse evaluation suite that focuses on tasks believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. Language models have already made good progress on this benchmark, with the best model in the BIG-Bench paper outperforming average reported human-rater results on 65\% of the BIG-Bench tasks via few-shot prompting. But on what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance, and are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models? In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average human-rater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.},

	abstract = {Scaling up language models has been shown to predictably improve performance and sample eﬃciency on a wide range of downstream tasks. This paper instead discusses an unpredictable phenomenon that we refer to as emergent abilities of large language models. We consider an ability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models. Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models. The existence of such emergence raises the question of whether additional scaling could potentially further expand the range of capabilities of language models.},
