## Introduction

The T5 paper is a classic paper and is currently widely used as a standard model in research and industry. Notably, at the time of publication, it was the largest model in the world by parameter count. In addition, it introduced the idea of a transformer encoder-decoder architecture (concurrently with Facebookâ€™s BART).  Exhaustive experiments 

- What is the name of the T5 paper?

    Text-to-Text Transformer

- T5 is short for `Text to Text Transfer Transformer`
    
    
- T5 frames every problem as a `Text to Text Task`

- T5 introduces the `Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus`
    
    C4 - 750 GB cleaned english text
    
    - They train on the scraped webtext for one month in 2018
- What is the pretraining objective for T5?
    - Masked spans of sentinel tokens (similar to BART)
    - Maximum likelihood using teacher forcing
    - Different from BART in that we predicting the full masked text rather than number of masked out tokens

- In T5 the supervised pretraining object is `text to text with the target being the masked tokens`

- T5 was trained for `1/4` as many pretraining steps as BERT base
    - note: it is also a much larger model
- T5 proposes the idea of a prefix attention mask to allow for better `representation of task specific prefixes`
    
    Intuition: Prefix should be able to attend to itself, not just rely on previous tokens:
    
    - Example: English prefix for NMT
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%202.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%202.png)
    
- Prefix Masking is useful in NMT to allow the `input sequence to attend to itself`
- Prefix Masking in T5 is analogous to BERT for classification in that `the input can attend to itself`
    - BERT ends up with a representation in a classification token
    - T5 outputs the correct classification from the language model itself

- How does the T5 paper compare encoder vs decoder vs encoder-decoder architectures?
    - Assume the number of parameters/ flops is roughly the same
    - They compared:
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%203.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%203.png)
    
- The T5 paper experiments `validate the importance` of the denoising objective from BERT
    - Give better performance over simple LM
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%204.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%204.png)
    
- The T5 paper compares various unsupervised objectives including BERT style `prefix language modeling` `deshuffling`
    - BERT style does the best
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%205.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%205.png)
    
- What simplifications to BERT pretraining objectives does the TF paper explore?
    - Only replacing with mask tokens (BERT replaces 15% with random tokens)
    - Replace Corrupted Tokens
    - Drop Corrupted Tokens
    
    All showed similar performance
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%206.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%206.png)
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%207.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%207.png)
    

- The T5 variants of dropping corrupted tokens or replacing corrupted spans is appealing because it `reduces training time` compared to the regular BERT objective
    - the target sequence has to attend over a smaller number of tokens
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%208.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%208.png)
    
- The T5 paper compared the effect of different corruption rates during pretraining and showed `no significant difference`
    - Stick with 15% from BERT
    - note: would expect performance to eventually degrade at higher rates
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%209.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%209.png)
    
- T5 showed that corrupting spans rather than individual tokens had `small effect`
    - Larger spans do have lower computational cost, due to representation as one token
    - Similar result was found in the spanBERT paper
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2010.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2010.png)
    
- Overall the T5 study on pretraining objectives showed `small differences among MLM variants`
    - Should also consider which variants have the lowest pretraining time
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2011.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2011.png)
    
- T5 compared different pretraining datasets and showed that domain specific datasets impacted `performance on specific downstream tasks`
    - Should pretrain on a relevant dataset for your task
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2012.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2012.png)
    
- T5 experiments showed performance `decreased` with less training data
    - Comparison is with equal numbers of pretraining steps
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2013.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2013.png)
    
    - Training on the full dataset once outperformed training on 1/64th of the dataset 64 times
    - note: this provides decent empirical support for the current paradigm of training large language models for a single epoch
- What transformer finetuning approaches are compared in T5?
    
    Note: Normal finetuning of a classifier on top of [cls] token representations as in BERT is not relevant for these encoder decoder models. 
    
    1. Adapter Layers: Add additional dense layers within each transformer block
        - Vary d, the inner dimension of these adapter layers
        - also have to update layernorm parameters
    2. Gradual Unfreezing: Gradually finetune more and more layers
    
- T5 finetuning experiments showed `degradation in performance`
    - was best to train all parameters
    - this is similar to the finding in the GOPHER finetuning experiments
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2014.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2014.png)
    
- What approaches to multitask learning are explored in T5?
    
    Multitask learning with their architecture is equivalent to doing the unsupervised training step of mixtures of different datasets
    
    - Examples Proportional Mixing
    - Temperature Scaled Mixing:
        - increasing temperature decreases imbalance between dataset sizes
    
    ![%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2015.png](/assets/images/:ExploringthelimitsofTransferLearningwithaUnifiedTexttoTextTransformer%20Explori%20bc626/Untitled%2015.png)
    

- How does the T5 paper reveal the "bitter lesson" in machine learning?
    - The bitter lesson is that scale/ computation is all that matters
    - T5 showed marginal difference between lots of different training objectives and datasets
    - Large scale of the model (11B parameters) seems to be all that is necessary to perform well
    - Ex: GPT3
    
- What scaling techniques does the T5 paper explore?
    - Increasing size
    - Increasing training steps
    - increasing batch size
    - Ensembling (average logits of multiple models)
    
    Increasing size seemed to do the best

- T5 results: achieved SOTA on `most GLUE and super GLUE tasks`
    
    Note 11B model is 30 times larger than BERT

## Conclusion

T5 is an important paper that introduced a new encoder-decoder transformer model. The exhaustive experiments provide insight into pre-training objectives, finetuning approaches and dataset selection. The T5 model forms the basis for many other works notably PromptTuning, ExT5, and T0. Many checkpoints are available from Huggingface.
